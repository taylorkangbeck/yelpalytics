All of the files except for statYelp.py are used for loading datasets into Postgres, cleaning up the data
by filtering it according to many parameters and computing some averages, and producing JSON rows that 
could be used for creating plots and doing statistical analysis.

statYelp.py performs statistical OLS analysis.
